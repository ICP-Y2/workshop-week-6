`Simulate a system with the specified conditions in Wokwi.`
### 1.	Write a short DHT22 sensor?
```
MENTION ITS USAGE



```
```
MENTION ITS CIRCUIT CONNECTION



```
```
MENTION ITS PROGRAM SETUP (MICRO PYTHON)



```
### 2.	What are the differences between LM35 and DHT22?
```
MENTION DIFFERENCES WITHIN SPECIFIC CATEGORY:



```
### 3.	Research how to interface DHT22 with ESP32 micropython and display the Current Humidity and Temperature on Serial Terminal.
```
HINT: LOOK FOR CIRCUIT CONNECTION AND PROGRAM SETUP FOR:
+ DHT22
+ SERIAL MONITOR 


```
**`SUBMIT THE SIMULATION VIDEO BELOW: `**


### 4.	Add Three LEDs: RED, GREEN and YELLOW
> a.	RED represents Alarm when temp > 40 or humidity < 50.
> 
> b.	YELLOW represents Warning when temp > 35 and < 40.
> 
> c.	GREEN when temp < 35 and humidity > 50

**`SUBMIT THE SIMULATION VIDEO BELOW: `**


### 5.	In above case, Add Control logic if needed.
```
HINT: USE OF POTENTIOMETER COULD BE USEFUL


```
